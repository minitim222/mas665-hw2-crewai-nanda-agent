### 🎤 Introduction Task Output
```
Hello everyone, I'm Tim Cao. I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computational Biology and Quantitative Genetics at Harvard, where I'm building on a strong foundation in statistics, biochemistry, and immunology. I earned my B.Sc. (Honors) from the University of Toronto in Statistics, Biochemistry & Immunology with High Distinction, and I've been honored to be on the Dean's List for four consecutive years (2021–2024). This mix of quantitative training and wet-lab insight has shaped how I approach biology: as a problem at the intersection of data, theory, and experiment.

My research sits at the crossroads of spatial transcriptomics and neural stem cell biology. I'm a graduate researcher at Boston Children's Hospital in the Newborn Medicine division, where I study neural stem cell regulation and the microglial signals that modulate their activity. My work encompasses spatial technologies—MERFISH, Xenium, and Visium HD—and I'm developing computational pipelines for anatomical segmentation and cell annotation. I'm also pursuing a first-author manuscript on how pregnancy remodels the neural stem cell niche, a project that blends developmental biology with state-of-the-art spatial analytics.

On the technical front, I bring a broad toolkit for computational biology and machine learning: Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scanpy), R (Seurat, Bioconductor), SQL, Bash; deep learning, CNNs, and transformers (BERT); multi-omics integration; and cloud/HPC workflows (AWS, GCP, SLURM, Docker, Snakemake). I'm especially focused on building reproducible pipelines for spatial omics datasets and developing methods for more accurate anatomical segmentation and cell annotation, with a particular emphasis on how microglial signals influence neural stem cell activity. My goal is to translate complex computational signals into biologically meaningful insights.

I've had the privilege to contribute to high-impact publications in Nature Neuroscience, Nature Communications, and Advanced Science, underscoring my ability to work across disciplines and collaborate effectively. I've been recognized with a first-place award at the UTSW Healthcare Case Competition in 2025 and over $30k in scholarships, reflecting both the rigor and the potential impact of my work. Beyond publications, I'm deeply committed to using computational methods to understand biological systems—from development and neural biology to spatial omics—always prioritizing reproducibility, efficiency, and clear communication. I'm excited to learn from and contribute to this class, applying robust, data-driven approaches to complex questions in neuroscience and beyond.
